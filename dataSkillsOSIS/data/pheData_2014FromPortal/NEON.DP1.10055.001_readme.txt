Data Product Description
This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's plant phenology sampling protocol. Phenophase status and intensity observations are made by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites throughout the growing season. Sampling is based on local seasonality, with more frequent sampling during times of rapid leaf phenology changes.  ~90 plants are monitored for phenology in each site.  These plants are located along a single 800m perimeter loop transect (200m/side), which is generally located within the tower airshed.  It is planned that a few additional plants will be monitored within view of the phenocam subsequent to phenocam deployment.  Phenophase status and intensity definitions follow those of the USA National Phenology network, although NEON protocols require only a subset of the full suite of NPN phenophases to be censussed.  For additional details on protocol, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Plant Phenology. Products resulting from this sampling include the species identification, phenophase status and intensity of each monitored plants, as well as a suite of ancillary measurements on size and disease status, which are repeated annually.  

Please note that our data portal architecture is still in development, and the current querying system will return data only if the user date range specified encompasses the date range at which a particular datum was collected. For plant phenology, tagged individuals may be monitored for phenology for several years after they are identified and
georeferenced. Expanding your date range to encompass the dates on which the individual was added to monitoring is necessary in order to return the information in the phe_perindividual table. Similarly, expanding your date range to encompass entire calendar
years is necessary to return the entire year's worth of phe_perindividualperyear data for a given site.

File naming convention for NEON observation systems data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC, where:
- NEON denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI
- DOM is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 � D20)
- SITE is four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code
- DPL is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level
- PRNUM is a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neoninc.org/data-product-catalog)
- REV is a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product; it is also used to track �Data Product Maturity�, from Engineering �Grade/Provisional to Science-Grade (001 = initial REV, Engineering-Grade or Provisional; 101 = initial REV, Science-Grade)
- DESC is an abbreviated description of the data product

These data are considered provisional (created using a baseline algorithm approach with a minimal or reduced set of QA/QC checks). Minor updates to the QA/QC and processing algorithms will occur during construction (prior to 2017). Changes to provisional data products will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed.  

Change log:
Deciduous Broadleaf trees with unfolded but immature leaves were incorrectly recorded as status=No  for the 'Leaves' phenophase at Domains 1 and 3. Phenophase status and intensity data on the portal prior to 20140314 (DSNY); 20140801 (JERC); 20131010 (OSBS); 20131121 (HARV); 20141014 (BART) are currently affected.
