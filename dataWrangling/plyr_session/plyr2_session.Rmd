# Outline 
1. Split-Apply-Combine Approach and Looping/Vectorized Methods Recap
2. Common uses of plyr
3. More Possibilities:
  * FSU Tools
  * Advanced Data Analysis
  * Massive data munging (.parallel, failwith() etc.)

### Libraries 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# libraries used
# if you don't have these, run: install.packages(c("plyr","dplyr","stringer","knitr")) 
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
```

##  1. The Split-Apply-Combine (SAC) Approach

### plyr() grammar

### Why vectorize (i.e. plyr, apply) your code over looping? 

The code is cleaner (once you'€™re familiar with the concept). The code can be easier to code and read, and less error prone because:

(a) you do no€™t have to deal with subsetting
(b) you do no€™t have to deal with saving your results

2. Apply functions can be faster than for loops, sometimes dramatically

### plyr vs. base-R apply functions

1. plyr has a common syntax, making it€” easier to remember
2. plyr requires less code since it takes care of the input and output format
3. plyr can easily be run in parallel a€” faster

## 2. More Uses of plyr

* We will use the ChickWeight dataset to explore other plyr arguments.
* ChickWeight tracks the effects of 4 diets on chicken weight through time
* Below, we use plyr to summarise a data frame in different ways. The non-R analog for this would be using a pivot table to analyze patterns in a spreadsheet. 


### Data Summary

* Use these to generate summaries of your data by some grouping
* Can be used to build nice tables (wrap the table into kable())
* Another potential use case is for error checking. Make your function detect cell by cell errors

```{r}
data(ChickWeight)
# Base R method - aggregate
aggregate(weight ~ Diet + Time, data = ChickWeight, mean)

# # plyr method - looks a bit more verbose...
ddply(ChickWeight, .(Time,Diet), summarise, avgWeight = mean(weight))

# add another column - standard deviation of weight ~ time + diet
with(ChickWeight, 
     aggregate(weight ~ Diet + Time, 
               FUN = function(x) c(avgWeight = mean(x), sdWeight = sd(x))))
#      

ddply(ChickWeight, .(Time,Diet), summarise, avgWeight = mean(weight), sdWeight = sd(weight))

# plyr adds a few additional functions 
# # Let's add on the same columns to the _original_ data frame (using head() to print first 20 rows)
# # transform _preserves_ data from the original data frame while adding the new columns - useful for comparing data 
ddply(ChickWeight, .(Time,Diet),transform, 
      avgWeight = mean(weight), 
      sdWeight = sd(weight)) 

# # what if we want to compare our new columns to the old columns e.g. 
# # the difference between a chick's weight and the average weight? 
# # 'mutate', another plyr argument, is functionally similar to 'transform' but will allow you to 
# # call or reference columns as they are created
ddply(ChickWeight, .(Time,Diet),mutate, # notice it is now 'mutate'
      avgWeight = mean(weight), # average weight per chick
      sdWeight = sd(weight), # stdev
      diffWeight = weight - avgWeight) # the difference in weights

# now try this same code, but use transform to see the output

# A few other (weird) plyr functions
# par(mfrow=c(3,2))
# r_ply(6, hist(rnorm(100)))

```

```{r}
# mapply function, similar to m_ply in plyr
mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1) # use repeat for the following: in list c(1,2,3,4), print it c(4,3,2,1) times
```
