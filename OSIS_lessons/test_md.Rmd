This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(xtable)
library(knitr)
library(shiny)
testdat <- read.csv(file = "~/GitHub/codingSupportGroup/spread.csv")
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
library(shiny)
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks",label = "Number of Bins:",
              choices = c(10,20,35,50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser Eruption Duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Rendering Tables/Spreadsheets

* xtable() does not seem to gel well with the latest Rmarkdown version (v2)

```{r results='asis'}
# testing formatting
xtable(testdat)
```

* However knitr::kable() spits out some nice output without wrapping the rows down the HTML page

```{r}
kable(testdat)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
