DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10003.001

Name: Breeding landbird point counts

Description: Count, distance from observer, and taxonomic identification of breeding landbirds observed during point counts

NEON Science Team Supplier: TOS

Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's breeding landbird sampling. Breeding landbirds are defined as “smaller birds (usually exclusive of raptors and upland game birds) not usually associated with aquatic habitats” (Ralph et al. 1993). The breeding landbird point counts product provides records of species identification of all individuals observed during the 6-minute count period, as well as metadata which can be used to model detectability, e.g., weather, distances from observers to birds, and detection methods. The NEON point count method is adapted from the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR): Field protocol for spatially-balanced sampling of landbird populations (Hanni et al. 2017; http://bit.ly/2u2ChUB). For additional details, see protocol [NEON.DOC.014041](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.014041vF): TOS Protocol and Procedure: Breeding Landbird Abundance and Diversity and science design [NEON.DOC.000916](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.000916vB): TOS Science Design for Breeding Landbird Abundance and Diversity.

Brief Design Description: Depending on the size of the site, sampling for this product occurs either at either randomly distributed individual points or grids of nine points each. At larger sites, point count sampling occurs at five to fifteen 9-point grids, with grid centers collocated with distributed base plot centers (where plant, beetle, and/or soil sampling may also occur), if possible. At smaller sites (i.e., sites that cannot accommodate a minimum of 5 grids) point counts occur at the southwest corner (point 21) of 5-25 distributed base plots. Point counts are conducted once per breeding season at large sites and twice per breeding season at smaller sites. Point counts are six minutes long, with each minute tracked by the observer, following a two-minute settling-in period. All birds are recorded to species and sex, whenever possible, and the distance to each individual or flock is measured with a laser rangefinder, except in the case of flyovers.

Brief Study Area Description: This sampling occurs at all NEON terrestrial sites.

- NEON denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

- DOM is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

- SITE is four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.

- DPL is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;

- PRNUM is a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog).

- REV is a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.

- HOR is the Spatial Index #1 and refers to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005.

- VER is the Spatial Index #2 and refers to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080.

- TMI is the Temporal Index; it is a three-digit designation and refers to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass.

- DESC is an abbreviated description of the data file or table.

- YYYY-MM represents the year and month of the data in the file (YYYY only is used for AOP data files).

- PKGTYPE is either 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded', representing the expanded download package (see more information below).

- GENTIME is the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ where YYYY = four-digit year, MM = two-digit month (01-12), DD = two-digit day (01-31), T = the indicator that the time stamp is beginning, HH = two-digit hour (00-23), mm = two-digit minute (00-59), SS = two-digit seconds (00-59), Z = UTC = Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time).

Basic download package definition: The basic package contains the per point metadata table that includes data pertaining to the observer and the weather conditions and the count data table that includes all of the observational data.

Expanded download package definition: The expanded package includes two additional tables and two additional fields within the count data table. The personnel table provides institutional information about each observer, as well as their performance on identification quizzes, where available. The references tables provides the list of resources used by an observer to identify birds. The additional fields in the countdata table are family and nativeStatusCode, which are derived from the NEON master list of birds.

Obfuscation of Personnel Information: At times it is important to know which data were collected by particular observers. In order to protect privacy of NEON technicians while also providing a way to consistently identify different observers, we obfuscate each NEON personnel name by internally linking it to a unique string identifier (e.g., Jane Doe=ByrziN0LguMJHnInl2NM/trZeA5h+c0) and publishing only the identifier.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS
------------------
Queries for this data product will return data collected during the date range specified for brd_perpoint and brd_countdata, but will return data from all dates for brd_personnel (quiz scores may occur over time periods which are distinct from when sampling occurs) and brd_references (which apply to a broad range of sampling dates). A record from brd_perPoint should have 6+ child records in brd_countdata, at least one per pointCountMinute. Duplicates or missing data may exist where protocol and/or data entry abberations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables.

NEON DATA POLICY AND CITATION GUIDELINES
----------------------------------------
The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. Please visit http://data.neonscience.org/data-policy for more information.
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
