Soils seasonal transition coding work

The goal of this effort is to devise an approach for determining site-specific seasonal
transition times for soil sampling. One occurs in the spring, and the other in the fall.
These time periods are intended to capture the "hot moments", when soil physical, chemical
and biotic properties are responding more rapidly to seasonal changes.

While at some sites the snowmelt period or time when the ground freezes are reliable 
and observable indicators, however at lower latitude sites or sites with wet/dry seasons,
these metrics tend to be irrelevant. For such sites, potential criteria include air temperature,
soil moisture, and NDVI index.

The current approach is to define the sampling window when the rates of change for these 
metrics are highest (e.g. when the slope of the change in AT and SM is largest). For NDVI
index, this might be the julian date of avg incr, or avg decr, plus or minus 2 weeks.

The working data set uses AT data from SERC for 2010-2014. Currently, I am working toward
compiling the 5 years of data into a single file. I've been managing dates by creating a
new field for Year and redefining Date as julianDate (Jan 1 of the year is the first day
for each data set).
From there, I created a new field for Week so that rows could be grouped by week. Not sure
if this is necessary/useful.

Remaining tasks:
1. Create a model for the temperature data. Not sure how to extract subsets of that for 
week-long or month-long analysis of slopes, and which temporal scale will work best. 
2. May want to create a model that treats each julianDate for the 5 years of data as replicates
of julianDate and model as an entire dataset. Then can conduct loess smoothing (or similar)
to find the ideal time period.
